# 🏥 Behind the Numbers: What NY's Hip Replacement Data Tells Us About Healthcare

There’s a story hidden in New York’s hospital discharge data — you just have to know how to look for it.  
In this project, I analyzed **elective hip replacement cases across the state** using Power BI, uncovering trends that reveal how our healthcare system really works.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### • Not All Recoveries Are Equal  
While the average patient stays **2.65 days** after surgery, hospital stay lengths vary widely — some discharge patients in half that time, while others keep them for a week or more.  
These differences often stem from **patient risk factors** and **post-operative care decisions**.

### • Geography Shapes Outcomes  
Patients in **New York City** hospitals tend to stay longer than those in **upstate regions**.  
This urban–rural divide reflects differences in:
- Patient populations  
- Hospital resources  
- Discharge practices

### • The Cost Mystery  
The cost of the same procedure can vary by **thousands to tens of thousands of dollars** between hospitals.  
These aren’t minor fluctuations — they point to **systemic pricing gaps** in healthcare.

## 📊 About the Dashboard

Built in **Power BI**, this dashboard helps visualize:
- Hospital performance comparisons  
- Cost variation across regions  
- Factors influencing recovery time and length of stay

It turns raw discharge data into a story that policymakers, healthcare professionals, and data analysts can explore and learn from.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

This analysis raises important questions:
- Why do some hospitals achieve **better outcomes at lower costs**?  
- What practices can others adopt from them?  
- How do we ensure that **quality care doesn't depend on your ZIP code**?

Understanding these patterns is a step toward **more equitable and efficient healthcare**.
